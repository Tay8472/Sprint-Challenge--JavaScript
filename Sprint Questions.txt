Describe the biggest difference between .forEach & .map.

.forEach doesn't create a new array, so you'd have to write in a blank array in a let and push your changes manually.
.map automatically creates a new array for you when you return it.

What is the difference between a function and a method?

Essentially a function is what builds an object or is an object, and a method is a function that belongs to an object.

Its a method for a function inside another function to reference or have access to outer function scopes.

Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.

Default binding just calls the single function ivocation.
Implicit binding means that the return or console.log with an object standing before a dot is what it will be.
With Explicit binding you can call a function to use a specific object.
With a New Binding you create an empty object and the this keyword references the properties of the original functiona and its prototypes.
